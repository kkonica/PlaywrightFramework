# gemfire-ui-automation
In this framework I have used Playwright as an automation tool and Cucumber as BDD tool
POM is the design pattern followed.
For reporting we are using Extent reports.
This framework is integrated with Jenkins as well.
Maven is used for Dependency management.

To run test cases:
1. We can run directly the feature file.
2. We can run the TestRunner file under runner folder.
3. We can run using mvn install/mvn test commands from terminal
